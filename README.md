<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This extension modifies all product lists in order to put all out of stock products in the last position. Sometimes we need to display out of stock products at the end of the product listing page. This is so we can display the products that are in stock to the user first. Default Magento show out of stock products at their regular position. Using the "Out of stock last" extension, you can show products at the last / bottom of the category listing page. This is very important from an SEO point of view. You can show the available and unavailable products but the available products will always be shown first. Your customers can see the available products in a category product list or in a product list search.</p>
<p>What you need to do is just install this extension and that's it. No need to configure anything. Easy to install and Easy to use.</p>
